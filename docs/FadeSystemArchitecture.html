<h1>Fade System Architecture</h1>
<p>Fade is a complex system.</p>
<p>It consists of an interpreter, a memory management system (complicated by a 
requirement to do very limited dynamic allocation, as that makes embedded 
systems cranky), and subsystem to drive the hardware to do useful things (dim 
LEDs, drive servos, read buttons, etc.) In addition, there is an ESP32-specific 
system that handles all web-based operations - the minimal web-based IDE, the 
ESP32 startup, etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>Fade consists of three projects.</p>
<p>The <strong>SequenceController</strong> project is the main projects; it 
contains all of the implementation for the system as it runs on the ESP32. It 
was authored using Visual Studio Code and Platform IO. All code with the 
exception of main.cpp is written inline as part of .h files; this simplifies the 
project (only one file per class) and enables the test architecture. </p>
<p>The <strong>SequenceControllerTest</strong> project contains all of the test 
code, most of which is unit test code. Though the include file path, it uses 
what I call "include file replacement" to include test-specific classes instead 
of the real ones that are used in the ESP32 version. For example, there is a 
test version of the Serial class that is used instead of the hardware one to 
capture serial outout from the system. The code is structured to make it easy to 
test - wherever possible, a single class can be tested simply by passing data 
and examing results rather than a mocking-based approach. In addition, the test 
code uses a pattern known as "port-adapter-simulator" to replace the hardware 
versions. </p>
<p>Any changes to the main code must be accompanied with new or updated unit 
tests. Changes to hardware-specific code may be possible without unit tests 
depending on the change. </p>
<p>The <strong>WinFade</strong> project contains the Windows-specific IDE. The 
project compiles the main SequenceController code as a callable library, and 
this library is used from the C# main code using the P/Invoke feature. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Animation Loop</h2>
<p>The entire system is structured around a 10 millsecond (100 hz) animation 
loop; the user code runs until it hits an animation point - explictly with an 
"A" command or implicitly as part of a "Di" or "Si" command - at which point the 
system executes the number of cycles specified in the animation command, 
blocking so that the overall execution runs at approximately 100 hz. There is no 
guard against operations taking too long other than common sense. </p>
<p>The system knows the current state of all outputs, and animation commands 
specify what the target state should be and how long - how many cycles - it 
should take to get there. All current devices use a floating point state from 
0-1 with the number of values defined by the type of device; a servo would use a 
single value from 0 to 1, and an RGB led would use an array "{a, b, c}" of three 
values. </p>
<h2>Output Devices</h2>
<p>All output devices are configured using the LedConfig() command, though not 
all devices are LEDs. </p>
<p>The proper output device is created based upon its textual name 
(LedDeviceCreator.h), and a list of the created devices is maintained. Each 
device specifies a group number and the number of pixels (aka "output channels") 
that it handles. The actual kind of output channel is not visible when writing 
code; you can define 10 RGB pixels, a single PWM LED, and a set of 3 servos, and 
they are then accessed using a single set of indices - the RGB pixels are 
outputs 0-9, the PWM led is output 10, and the servos are outputs 11-13. </p>
<p>In addition to physical devices, there are virtual devices...</p>
<p>Sender devices - such as the LedUdpSender device - accept channel updates 
like the physical output devices but instead of driving physical hardware, they 
package the data up and send it to another microcontroller to running fade. This 
overcomes hardware limitations on the number of PWM/servo channels.</p>
<p>Receiver devices - such as the LedUdpReceiver device - accept the channel 
update data from another system and feed it into the current set of output 
devices as if it were local. </p>
<p>WinFade can also send updates in UDP so that the receiver controller can be 
tested. </p>
<h2>The Interpreter</h2>
<p>The language input is broken into tokens by ExpressionTokenSource. </p>
<p>The Fade language is implemented using a hand-coded recursive-descent parser, 
implemented in RDEvaluator.h. </p>
<p>The file is ordered roughly based on precedence, with the high precedence 
constructs at the top of the file and the lower precedence constructs at the 
bottom of the file. </p>
<p>Function calls parameters are implemented using specially-named variables in 
the newly-created function scope; the number of arguments is passed using the 
"#A" variable, and the arguments themselves are passed using "#A&lt;n&gt;", where &lt;n&gt; 
is the argument number. These arguments are then validated against the declared 
parameters in the function body and renamed appropriately using the function 
parameter names. </p>
<p>Built-in functions are implemented in builtinfunctions.h and can easily be 
extended by following the existing pattern. Please write unit tests for them if 
practical. </p>
