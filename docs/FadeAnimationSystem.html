<h1>Fade Animation System</h1>
<p>The Fade Animation System is a software program that runs on the ESP-32 
microcontroller and makes it easy to create animations using either addressable 
WS2812 LEDs (aka "Neopixels") or PWM-based LEDs. </p>
<p>Fade animations are written using a language known as "Fade". Fade animation 
code can easily be modified using any web browser by connecting to the ESP-32. </p>
<p>In addition to the firmware that runs on the ESP-32, there is the WinFade 
authoring and testing environment that runs on Windows. This allows you to 
author and test various animations quickly without downloading them to the 
ESP-32. When you have an animation working the way you want, you can easily 
download it to the ESP from withing the WinFade Environment. </p>
<p>A video introduction of the system is here.</p>
<p>A Fade language reference is <a href="FadeLanguageReference.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>A Fade language tutorial is <a href="FadeLanguageTutorial.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>Source code for the system lives on GitHub
