Goal:

To be able to do simple sequencing and dimming of low-current (1 amp-ish) loads with a cheap and simple board.

* ESP32 based, to get up to 16 outputs (all can be PWMed)
* Board to plug an ESP dev board in and hold the MOSFETS
* Small Mosfets
* 8 outputs by default, chain a second board (stack?) to support a full 16 outputs.
* Board only switches input to ground, so 8 separate outputs rather than +/- on each output.
* Software based on existing controller? 
* 5V or 12V? (can onboard regulator work okay for 12V?)
* Are driver transistors needed to switch fast enough?
* Can outputs be paralled to get more current? 

Investigation:

* Select mosfets and test with target load and different dimming levels.
* Start board design.
